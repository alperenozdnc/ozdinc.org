      i'm a self-taught programmer that started with front-end web development,
      <br />
      but i've recently been trying to go low-level. i program because i love
      it, not for any other reason. <br />
      i'm currently in high school and i've been programming for 5 years now.
    </p>

    <p>
      the easiest thing to do would be to make this website with a phony,
      "excited" attitude about how i <br />
      also ride the "aspiring developer" train like any other one of the hundred
      million other developers. <br />
      i also could have made this using blazingly shitty new technologies
      released a week ago. <br />
      but to me, that feels really easy and fake.

      programming is like trying to convince a baby that it's intelligent. in
      the end, you may achieve your goal, but you are left sleepless, with torn
      out hair, missing 2 days worth of food, wondering why you're even alive.
